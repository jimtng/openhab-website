One year has passed since our big [openHAB 4.0 release](/blog/2023-07-23-openhab-4-0-release.html), and we are thrilled to announce our first summer minor release of the openHAB 4.x series: openHAB 4.2.
openHAB 4.2 adds a number of exciting new features, including the long awaited notification enhancements, as well as a multitude of smaller improvements and bug fixes.

With that being said, we as usual want to share our highlights and some statistics that show the activity in numbers.

# Activity

As you'd expect from any new openHAB release, we have had a high activity across all our GitHub repositories.
We therefore want to share a few statistics about our three main repositories: Core, add-ons and UIs.

[openHAB Core](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-core) has received XXX pull requests in total, with XX bug fixes and XX enhancements resulting in XX,xxx lines of code added.

X new add-ons, XX bug fixes and XXX enhancements were contributed to the [openHAB add-ons repository](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-addons), which resulted in the addition of XX,xxx lines of code.

The [openHAB web UIs](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-webui) have broken their "personal" best with a whopping XXX pull requests, including XX bug fixes and XX enhancements and resulting in X,xxx lines of code added.

It is worth to mention, that [our other repositories](https://github.com/openhab) have also received numerous contributions (e.g. documentation), but listing them all would probably be too much here.
Many thanks to all our contributors for driving openHAB forward!

Again, it is time to shout out to our top code contributors per repository (having done the most commits) for this new release:

- Wouter ([@wborn](https://github.com/wborn)) for openHAB core
- Holger ([@holgerfriedrich](https://github.com/holgerfriedrich)) for openHAB core
- Jan ([@J-N-K](https://github.com/J-N-K)) for openHAB core
- Jacob ([@jlaur](https://github.com/jlaur)) for openHAB add-ons
- Holger ([@holgerfriedrich](https://github.com/holgerfriedrich)) for openHAB add-ons
- Florian ([@florian-h05](https://github.com/florian-h05)) for the openHAB Main UI
- Jimmy ([@jimtng](https://github.com/jimtng)) for the openHAB Main UI
- Laurent ([@lolodomo](https://github.com/lolodomo)) for the openHAB Basic UI

Many of our top committers are also maintainers, which means besides contributing code, they also review pull requests and participate in discussions on GitHub issues, which helps maintain our high level of quality across bindings, UIs and Core.
At present, we have 36 maintainers across all our repositories.
Huge thanks to all of them for keeping a high development pace for openHAB 4.2!

# Highlights

As you might have already noticed in the activity statistics, there was much development on openHAB - too much to list everything.
Please refer to the [**release notes**](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-distro/releases/tag/4.2.0) to check out what's new and noteworthy (e.g. breaking changes).

In the following sections, our maintainers and contributors are introducing some new features you don't want to miss!

## Notification Enhancements

Huge thanks to Dan Cunningham ([@digitaldan](https://github.com/digitaldan)) for doing all the work on openHAB Cloud, the Cloud Connector add-on and the iOS app!

Many thanks to our app maintainers [@weakfl](https://github.com/weakfl), Dan Cunningham ([@digitaldan](https://github.com/digitaldan)), Tim Bert ([@timbms](https://github.com/timbms)) [@mueller-ma](https://github.com/mueller-ma) and Danny Baumann ([@maniac103](https://github.com/maniac103)) for all their work on the apps!

## Core Runtime Enhancements

### Persistence Extensions

## Main UI Enhancements

### Dependency 6 Build System Upgrades

openHAB 4.2 upgrades most of Main UI's dependencies to their latest version, including our charting engine [Apache ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org) and our date and time manipulation library [dayjs](https://day.js.org).
As Main UI is still using Vue 2, we would like to upgrade to Vue 3 in the future - by upgrading to the latest Vue 2.x version, we have taken a minor step towards Vue 3.

In addition to our runtime dependencies, we have also upgraded our build system to the latest tooling: Webpack 5 and Node.js 20.
This ensures we can always use the latest Webpack features when bundling the Main UI source code, and moves away from Node.js 16, which is now EOL.

Many thanks to Miguel Álvarez ([@GiviMAD](https://github.com/givimad)) for the Webpack upgrade!

### Semantic Model Templates

### Persistence Settings Menu

Persistence configuration through the UI has been [supported since openHAB 4.0](/blog/2023-07-23-openhab-4-0-release.html#persistence-configuration), but unfortunately it was hidden in the add-on settings and difficult to find.

This finally changes with openHAB 4.2 with the introduction of the new persistence settings menu:

<p align="center"><img style="max-width: 70%;" src="/uploads/2024-07-07-openhab-4-2-release/persistence-menu.png"/></p>

The new page is reachable through the settings menu and allows to configure the default persistence service, persistence policies and installation of more persistence add-ons.

Thanks to Mark Herwege ([@mherwege](https://github.com/mherwege)) for the contribution!

### Item Form Enhancements

Items are one of the core elements in an openHAB system.
To make viewing and editing them easier and more streamlined, the Item Form has received some minor cosmetic and functional improvements.
For dimensioned items, it is now easier to set the item's unit directly on the form with a default unit pre-filled.
Managing item's parent groups should now be easier too.

### Add-on Store Redesign

The Add-on Store has been split up into sub-sections on the left navigation tree according to their category.
The main Add-on Store page now shows the list of all installed add-ons, grouped by category, for a quick overview.
The search box on the main Add-on Store page allows searching through all add-ons in every category.
The search box on the sub-category page searches only the selected category.

Browsing through the Add-ons Store and switching through the different sections is now much faster, thanks to cached results.
This makes browsing and installing add-ons through the UI easier and quicker.

### Setup Wizard Extensions

With the introduction of [add-on suggestions](/blog/2023-12-22-openhab-4-1-release.html#add-on-suggestions) in openHAB 4.1, we made a first, big step towards a better first-user experience.

openHAB 4.2 continues this path by extending the setup wizard with a separate step for persistence.
In this step, suggested persistence add-ons are shown and it is explained, why these add-ons are suggested to be installed:

<p align="center"><img style="max-width: 35%;" src="/uploads/2024-07-07-openhab-4-2-release/setup-wizard-persistence.png"/></p>
<p align="center"><img style="max-width: 35%;" src="/uploads/2024-07-07-openhab-4-2-release/setup-wizard-addons.png"/></p>

As you can see in the screenshots, it recognizes which add-ons are already installed and adds explanations to the JavaScript Scripting and the Astro binding suggestions.

Many thanks to Mark Herwege ([@mherwege](https://github.com/mherwege)), who already worked on the add-on suggestions in openHAB 4.1, for this enhancement!

### `oh-context` Component

### Health UI

Ever heard of orphaned links before? Orphaned links are channel links, where either the Item or the channel (or possibly even both) are missing.

As you can imagine, orphaned links can and should be removed.
The new health UI allows to easily check if there are orphaned links and take care of them:

<p align="center"><img style="max-width: 70%;" src="/uploads/2024-07-07-openhab-4-2-release/health-menu.png"/></p>
<p align="center"><img style="max-width: 70%;" src="/uploads/2024-07-07-openhab-4-2-release/health-orphaned-links.png"/></p>

Checking and handling orphaned links is just the beginning for the new health UI - we plan to extend it in the future.
Stay tuned!
